What I have left to do is figure out why the queries don't work on Mifos as Tables. I also have to make a Pentaho report for all of them except Loan Evaluation Sheet. Then I will have to try again to figure out how to upload Pentaho reports to Mifos.

All the queries are ready, but I'm trying to get them ready to run on Mifos and hopefully as Pentaho reports by the time the migration is complete.
