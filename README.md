# pentaho

All the reports I'm working on are here in the main folder. I keep track of which ones are done, and what needs to be done for the rest, in the status_of_work.txt file.

*If you're looking for the MySQL queries that I used in the reports, they are in the queries folder.

The other folders are just to help organize my work, except the report-designer folder which contains the Pentaho Report Designer program (version 6.1.9-GA I believe)
