# pentaho

The goal is to share as many reports and queries as possible. 

Therefore, they are not organized by the office where they are used. Instead all completed reports are together.


###Explanation of Folders
If a Pentaho report is not done, it should be in the "incomplete" folder.

*If you're looking for the MySQL queries for the reports, they are in the queries folder.

The report-designer folder contains the Pentaho Report Designer program (version 3.9.1-GA I believe)

The stretchy-report folder contains the SQL for "Table" style reports.

###How to run Pentaho Report Designer
Once you have this repo cloned to your computer, you can run Report Designer without any further installation steps. Just navigate to the report-designer folder, and if you're using Windows double click the report-designer.bat file. 

If you're using Linux, run the report-designer.sh file. You might need to open the linux command line and navigate to the file then use ./report-designer.sh. Or if you have settings where you can double click to run, you can double click the file.
