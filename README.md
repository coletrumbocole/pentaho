# pentaho

The goal is to share as many reports and queries as possible. 

Therefore, they are not organized by the office where they are used. Instead all completed reports are together.

If a Pentaho report is not done, it should be in the "incomplete" folder.

*If you're looking for the MySQL queries for the reports, they are in the queries folder.

The report-designer folder contains the Pentaho Report Designer program (version 6.1.9-GA I believe)

The stretchy-report folder contains the SQL for "Table" style reports.
