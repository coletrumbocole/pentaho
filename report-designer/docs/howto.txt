To generate proper JavaHelp from the output from Jem/Doc team:

1.  install javahelp (version 2.0)
2.  unzip the jar provided by doc
3.  run jhindexer from jh20/javahelp/bin/jhindexer against the "topic" of interest
    currently this means to run it against "evaluation_technical"
4.  a JavaHelpSearch folder will be created, move that into the evaluation_technical folder
    of the original jar
5.  delete any resources created during unzip (step 4 put new stuff in jar)

E.g.:
\report-designer-assembly\resource\docs>\jh2.0\javahelp\bin\jhindexer evaluation_technical
